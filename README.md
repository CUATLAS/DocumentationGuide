# Documentation & Building an Online PResence

This is a guide for ATLAS students that outlines best practices for documentation and the importance of building an online presence. All ATLAS students are highly encouraged to document their work online in a work-in-progress journal, and some courses will require this practice. This document outlines our suggestions for building a digital record of your work that showcases your process as well as your technical and creative abilities.


## Strong Documentation Habits
+ Always include a written description. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can understand it. 
+ When documenting an interactive work, be sure to communicate the role of the user. Diagrams are helpful for this. 
+ Use pictures, drawings, schematics, and videos liberally to explain your work.
+ Document your projects thoroughly as you go, don’t put it off until the end. You can begin a post and continue to edit and add content to that post as the project progresses.
+ Make sure any code you post is well-commented, so you and others can understand what it does. Gist works well for embedding code snippets. For larger programs, it is ideal to link to a Github repository. Don’t overload your notes with code!!
+ Cite your sources - this includes existing research, code samples, schematics, fabrication techniques - anything that you did not personally generate. Remember, your journal lives on the internet, so use hyperlinks throughout your posts.
